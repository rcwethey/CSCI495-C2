# CSCI495-C2

## Description / Purpose
Well, I did a 180 on this project from the last one and made it essentially almost entirely back-end using php. I am in the process of learning more on Node.js and React so I didn't feel confident in using those languages, so instead, since time was short for this cycle I decided to use a langauge I knew the most when dealing with Back the back end. The prupose of this site was to show that focusing on the back-end alone, I could produce something that was of some substance while not even worrying about the front-end. The website is suppose to be a site for eyeglasses that someone could register for and essentially after an appointment, sign up for delivery, create an account for more orders, etc. 


## Dependencies
The one depency are the ccursearch phpMyAdmin for a database.

## Usage
This project deals a lot with login systems. It also deal with forms that can be repoulated, data that can be manipulated so that you can update your information or need be and admin can change information for anyone having essentially a front-end access to an entire database without ever really touching it. 

## Future Work
There could be a lot in store for this website if I were to make a compatible front-end, for that I would need to entirely throw out the html and css and start from scratch, but it is do-able. 

## What is your major and how this project is related to your major.
I am a computer information systems major and we have learned quite a bit about webdevelopment but not as much as I have learened and am currently learning on my own. We tocuhed upon php in some of the older classes and I wanted to show that I could donsomething with it again now that I have been out of those classes for a little bit of time now. I know that php is an outdated langauge, but due to time contraints, and the lack of knowledge in other up-to-date languages, I was pressed to essentially work on this project and finish it so I could prpepare myself for something that could be more in the future.
